I am a 4th year PhD candidate at the School of Engineering and Sciences</a>, 
	Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico, advised by Dr. Jose Tamez-Peña. Before joining this institute, I was working as a lecturer at Shaikh Ayaz University, Shikarpur, Pakistan. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing. I have been working on developing multimodal deep learning models for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
